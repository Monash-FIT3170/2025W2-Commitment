## Environment Setup
Follow the below steps to set up your Docker environment for development.

### Docker Installation
Docker Desktop can be installed for all platforms from the official website, [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Scroll Below *Choose Plan*).

#### Select Target Platform
Depending on your device you can choose the target platform:
- Download for Mac - **Apple Silicon**
- Download for Mac - **Intel Chip**
- Download for Windows AMD64 - **Windows (64-bit)**
- Download for Windows ARM64 - **Snapdragon Laptops**
- Download for Linux - **Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.**

#### Install Docker Desktop
1. Open the downloaded installer: **Docker Desktop Installer exe**.
2. Follow the installation prompts.
3. Enable WSL2 Backend (recommended).
4. Restart device to complete installation.

#### Install Verification
1. Open native terminal on device.
2. Run `docker --version` to verify the installation.

*If there are any issues please contact an SA for help.*

### Building the Environment
These next steps are required to build and spin up the Docker image that will be used. 
1. Ensure that you are in the **root directory** of the project and open a terminal.
2. Run `docker-compose build` to build the image.
    - This may take some time!
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to spin it up and attach to a container.
4. The container is ready for development.

### Docker Commands
These commands are useful for working with the container but must be run from the root directory of the project.

| Use | Command |
|---|---|
| Start Container | `docker-compose start` |
| Stop Container  | `docker-compose stop` |
| Access Dev Container | `docker exec -it 3170-env bash` |
| Access Mongo Container | `docker exec -it mongo bash` |

## Running Project
These provide steps to run the project.
1. In the root directory of the project start the container.
2. Once it has started enter the `3170-env` container, this should take you into the `\commitment` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies, this may take some time.
4. Run `meteor` to run the application.
    - This will be mapped to your `localhost` on `PORT 3000`.

## Git Practices
This next section briefly goes over practices for the team.

### Commits
- Keep commits **small** and **meaningful**, one responsibility per commit.
- Use **brief and clear** messages describing the change.
- Commit frequently, but avoid noisy or vague messages.
All commits must follow the **Conventional Commits** format:

`type(scope): message`

More details on `type` of commits can be found [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

### Branching
#### Locked Branches:
- `main`: **No direct commits allowed** â€“ all changes must go through Pull Requests (PRs).

#### Creating Feature Branches:
- Create a new branch for each new feature or fix.
- **Do not** commit to someone else's branch without permission.
- To collaborate, raise a PR to their branch with a clear message.

#### Branch Naming Conventions:
- Use **dashes (`-`)** instead of spaces.
- Avoid **nested branches** (e.g., `feature/test/test-branch`).

| Type       | Prefix  | Example             |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| Feature    | `feat/` | `feat/login-page`   |
| Bug Fix    | `fix/`  | `fix/metrics-bug`   |
| Temporary  | `temp/` | `temp/test-branch`  |

### Pull Requests (Merge Requests)

- **All changes** must go through a Pull Request.
- Share PRs via the `#pull-requests` Discord channel.
- PRs must be **squashed and merged** to keep history clean.
- A PR must be **reviewed and approved** before being merged into `main`.

### How to run server

- navigate to the server folder in terminal
- run 'npm run dev'
- server should be running at local host

## How to create a .env file

- .env file should be placed in the server folder
- we need to create variables for the containers and an entry way to atlas
- use the example_env_file to fill your new one, you should only need to change the ATLAS_MONOGO_URI with your own one. 
- Please text Janidu to get added to ATLAS, you will also need to add your i.p. address
